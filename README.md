# Solara  
This is a Roblox exploit called Solara and this Exploit does not work.
This is a fake Roblox executor / exploit and it don't harms nor steals something from the OS.
This is a simple script that runs the other file if in the same dictonary and then if you press "inject" you'll shut of your OS (only working on Windows and Linux)
You can prank your friends with a "pre- realesed Solara beta and they shut of their OS and you can say "you got a virus now." 
Please take this as a Joke and this is not a real roblox executor.
